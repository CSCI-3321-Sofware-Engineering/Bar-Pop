# Bar-Pop
Bar-pop is currently under development. The user interface will be a mobile application developed for IOS and Android using Xarmin.Forms. 

## Purpose
The goal of Bar-Pop is a mobile application that provides population metrics, event, and location data to customers looking for nightlife venues in Savannah GA. Additionally, we seek to provide a mobile application interface for nightlife venue staff that provides population metrics and the ability to edit event data for their venue.

## Overview
Bar-Pop uses laser hardware installed at each venue to count the number of people entering and exiting. The number of people are stored in a database that the mobile application can access and report to a user through an intuitive maps interface like Google Maps. Locations of each venue are represented by pins of varying color depending on the ratio of people at each location divided by location size. Upon pressing a pin, users can view further information such as events and potentially walking distance and reviews.
